# Brain Image Registration 2D

## Overview

This is part of the Medical Image Registration and Applications Course

This project implements a 2D image registration framework designed for aligning brain images. It includes:

	- Rigid Transformation: Aligns images by optimizing translation and rotation.
	- Affine Transformation: Adds scaling and shearing to the alignment process.
	- Similarity Metrics:
	- Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)
	- Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)
	- Normalized Gradient Correlation (NGC)
	- Multi-Resolution Framework: Utilizes Gaussian pyramids to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy.
